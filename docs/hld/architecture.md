## Main Components

- **API Gateway:** Handles all client requests and routing.
- **Service Layer:** Business logic is implemented in modular services.
- **Database:** Stores persistent data, supports replication and backup.
- **Cache:** Improves read performance and reduces DB load.
- **Message Queue:** Decouples services and enables async processing.
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Provides observability.

---

## Key Design Decisions

- **Technology stack:** Python (FastAPI), PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, Prometheus/Grafana
- **Scalability:** Each component can be scaled horizontally.
- **Security:** JWT-based authentication at API layer.
- **Resilience:** Retry policies, timeouts, health checks.
