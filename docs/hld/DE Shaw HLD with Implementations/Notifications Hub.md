# Notifications Hub (Email/SMS/Push/Webhooks)

## 1. Problem Statement & Requirements
Design a scalable notifications hub to send messages via email, SMS, push, and webhooks, with templating, retries, and per-channel failover.

**Functional Requirements:**
- Request API for notifications
- Templating engine for dynamic content
- Rate limits and idempotency per recipient/channel
- Retries and dead-letter queue (DLQ) for failures
- Per-channel provider failover
- Status tracking and audit logs

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- 10â€“100M messages/day
- High reliability, at-least-once delivery
- Low-latency for critical notifications

**Assumptions:**
- Multiple providers per channel (e.g., Twilio, SendGrid)
- Outbox/event sourcing for reliability

---
## 2. High-Level Architecture

**Components:**
- **Request API:** Accepts notification requests
- **Template Renderer:** Renders message content
- **Send Queue:** Buffers messages for delivery
- **Channel Workers:** Deliver messages to providers
- **Provider Adapters:** Integrate with email/SMS/push/webhook providers
- **DLQ:** Stores failed messages for retry/manual review
- **Status Store:** Tracks delivery status
- **Audit Log:** Records all events

**Architecture Diagram:**
```
 [API] -> [Template] -> [Queue] -> [Channel Worker] -> [Provider] -> [DLQ]
                                 |
                                 v
                            [Status/Audit]
```

## 3. Data Model & Delivery Logic

- **Notification:** { id, recipient, channel, template, params, status, ... }
- **Provider:** { id, type, priority, ... }
- **Status:** { notification_id, state, timestamp }
- **DLQ Entry:** { notification_id, reason, retries }

---
## 4. Key Workflows

### a) Notification Request
1. API receives notification request
2. Template renderer generates content
3. Message enqueued for delivery

### b) Delivery & Retry
1. Channel worker picks message, selects provider
2. Sends to provider; on failure, retries with backoff
3. On repeated failure, moves to DLQ

### c) Status Tracking & Audit
1. Status store updated on each delivery attempt
2. Audit log records all events

---
## 5. Scaling & Reliability

- **Horizontal Scaling:** Stateless API/workers, scale by QPS
- **DLQ:** Ensures no message lost
- **Provider Failover:** Multiple providers per channel
- **Monitoring:** Delivery rates, failures, latency

---
## 6. Trade-offs & Alternatives

- **At-least-once vs Exactly-once:** At-least-once is simpler, exactly-once is complex
- **Synchronous vs Async Delivery:** Async for scale, sync for critical

---
## 7. Best Practices & Extensions

- Use idempotency keys for deduplication
- Per-channel rate limits
- Analytics for delivery and engagement
- Integrate with user preferences and opt-outs

---
## 8. Example Pseudocode (Delivery Worker)
```python
def deliver_message(msg):
    for provider in get_providers(msg.channel):
        try:
            send_to_provider(provider, msg)
            update_status(msg.id, 'delivered')
            return
        except Exception:
            continue
    move_to_dlq(msg)
```
