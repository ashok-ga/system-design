# Job Scheduler (cron + DAGs) â€” Deep Dive

## 1. Problem Statement & Scope
Design a reliable, scalable job scheduling and orchestration platform for cron and DAG-based workflows (like Airflow/Prefect). The system must support complex dependencies, retries, monitoring, high availability, and extensibility for custom operators and plugins.

## 2. Functional & Non-Functional Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Define workflows as DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) of tasks
- Trigger jobs on schedule (cron), event, or manually
- Manage dependencies, retries, backoff, and failure handling
- UI/API for workflow management, monitoring, and manual intervention
- Support for parameterized and dynamic DAGs
- SLA monitoring and alerting
- Backfill and rerun for missed/failed jobs

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability:** 10k+ concurrent jobs, 100k+ tasks/day
- **Reliability:** No job loss, strong guarantees, at-least-once execution
- **Extensibility:** Support custom operators, plugins, and hooks
- **Observability:** Real-time status, logs, and metrics
- **Security:** Role-based access, audit logs

## 3. Capacity & Scale Estimation

- **Workflows:** 10k active DAGs
- **Tasks/DAG:** Avg 10
- **Job Rate:** 1k/sec peak
- **Log Storage:** 1TB+/month

## 4. High-Level Architecture

    Queue --> WorkerFleet[Worker Fleet]
    WorkerFleet --> ObjectStorage[Object Storage]
    Scheduler --> Monitoring[Monitoring/Alerting]
    Scheduler --> UIAPI[UI/API]
```

## 5. Data Model & API Design

### API Endpoints
- `POST /v1/dags`: Create DAG
- `POST /v1/dags/{dag_id}/runs`: Trigger run
- `GET /v1/dags/{dag_id}/runs/{run_id}`: Get status
- `POST /v1/dags/{dag_id}/backfill`: Backfill DAG
- `GET /v1/tasks/{task_id}/logs`: Get task logs

### Data Models
- **DAG:** {dag_id, definition, schedule, owner, ...}
- **DagRun:** {run_id, dag_id, status, start_time, end_time}
- **TaskInstance:** {task_id, run_id, status, retries, logs, sla_deadline}

## 6. Detailed Component Breakdown

- **Scheduler:** Core orchestrator. Evaluates schedules, triggers DAG runs, manages state, handles retries and backoff
- **Metadata DB:** Stores DAG definitions, run history, task state, and audit logs
- **Message Queue:** Decouples scheduling from execution. Ensures reliable delivery of tasks to workers
- **Worker Fleet:** Stateless workers execute tasks, autoscale, heartbeat for liveness
- **Object Storage:** Stores logs, artifacts, and large outputs
- **Monitoring/Alerting:** Tracks job status, failures, metrics, and SLAs
- **UI/API:** For workflow management, monitoring, and manual intervention

## 7. End-to-End Workflows

### a) DAG Run
1. User triggers DAG run (manual, scheduled, or event)
2. Scheduler creates DagRun in DB
3. Scheduler enqueues runnable tasks to Message Queue
4. Workers fetch tasks, execute, write logs/artifacts to Object Storage
5. Workers update task status in DB
6. Scheduler monitors progress, retries failed tasks with backoff
7. SLA monitor triggers alerts if deadlines missed
8. User/UI receives status updates

### b) Backfill & Rerun
1. User triggers backfill for missed/failed runs
2. Scheduler re-plans DAG, enqueues tasks as needed

### c) SLA Monitoring & Alerting
1. SLA monitor tracks deadlines for each task
2. Alerts sent to ops/on-call if missed

## 8. Scaling, Fault Tolerance, and Trade-offs

- **Scaling:**
    - Partition queues and worker pools for scale
    - Use distributed scheduler for HA
- **Fault Tolerance:**
    - All state persisted in DB, durable queue
    - Workers heartbeat, zombie detector for failures
    - At-least-once execution, idempotent tasks
- **Trade-offs:**
    - Strong guarantees add complexity; eventual consistency possible for non-critical metrics
    - Centralized scheduler is simple, distributed is more resilient

## 9. Security & Operational Considerations

- **Security:**
    - Role-based access for job creation and management
    - All actions logged for audit
- **Monitoring:**
    - Real-time dashboards for job status, failures, and SLAs
- **Disaster Recovery:**
    - Regular DB and artifact backups

## 10. Best Practices & Industry Insights

- Use DAGs for complex dependencies, cron for simple schedules
- Persist all state for reliability
- Use idempotent jobs to handle retries safely
- Integrate with alerting/on-call for SLA misses
- Design for manual override, backfill, and dynamic scaling

This design is inspired by Airflow, Prefect, Argo, and other industry workflow engines, and can be extended for event-driven triggers, dynamic scaling, and multi-tenant support.
