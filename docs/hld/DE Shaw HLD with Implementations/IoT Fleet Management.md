# IoT Fleet Management

### 1. Problem Statement & Scope

Design a cloud-native platform to manage a large fleet of IoT devices. The system must support secure onboarding, high-volume telemetry ingestion, remote control, device shadowing, and over-the-air (OTA) firmware updates, with high reliability and scalability.

### 2. Requirements

- **Functional Requirements:**
    - Secure device onboarding and authentication.
    - Ingest and store high-frequency telemetry from devices.
    - Remote command/control (e.g., reboot, config update).
    - Device shadow (digital twin) for state sync.
    - OTA firmware updates to devices.
- **Non-Functional Requirements:**
    - **Scalability:** 1M+ devices, 10k+ messages/sec.
    - **Reliability:** No data loss, strong delivery guarantees.
    - **Security:** TLS, mutual auth, role-based access.

### 3. Capacity Estimation

- **Devices:** 1M.
- **Telemetry Rate:** 1 msg/sec/device = 1M/sec.
- **Storage:** 1KB/msg, 1TB/day.

    A[Device] --> B[MQTT Broker Cluster];
    B --> C[Device Registry];
    B --> D[Device Shadow Service];
    B --> E[Rules Engine];
    E --> F[Time-series DB];
    E --> G[OTA Update Service];
    D --> H[Shadow DB];
    G --> I[Firmware Store];
    C --> J[User Portal/API];
`

### 5. Data Schema & API Design

- **API:**
    - `POST /v1/devices`: Register device.
    - `POST /v1/devices/{id}/command`: Send command.
    - `POST /v1/ota/deployments`: Deploy firmware.
- **Data Models:**
    - **Device Registry:** `device_id, cert, status, metadata`
    - **Device Shadow:** `device_id, reported, desired, last_sync`
    - **Telemetry:** `device_id, ts, payload`
    - **OTA Deployment:** `deployment_id, firmware_url, status`

### 6. Detailed Component Breakdown

- **MQTT Broker Cluster:** Handles device connections, message routing, and QoS.
- **Device Registry:** Stores device identities, certificates, and metadata.
- **Device Shadow Service:** Maintains digital twin for each device, syncs state.
- **Rules Engine:** Processes telemetry, triggers alerts/actions.
- **Time-series DB:** Stores telemetry for analytics and monitoring.
- **OTA Update Service:** Manages firmware deployments, tracks status.
- **Firmware Store:** Stores firmware binaries.
- **User Portal/API:** For device management and monitoring.

### 7. End-to-End Flow (Telemetry Ingest & OTA Update)

    MQTT->>Rules: Route message
    Rules->>TSDB: Store telemetry
    User->>OTA: Deploy firmware
    OTA->>Firmware: Fetch binary
    OTA->>MQTT: Notify device
    Device->>MQTT: Download & update
    MQTT->>OTA: Report status
`

### 8. Bottlenecks, Fault Tolerance, and Trade-offs

- **Bottleneck: MQTT Broker:**
    - Use clustering, horizontal scaling. Partition by device_id.
- **Telemetry Storage:**
    - Time-series DB optimized for high ingest.
- **OTA Updates:**
    - Staged rollout, retries for reliability.
- **Trade-offs:**
    - MQTT is efficient for IoT, but HTTP is simpler for some use cases.
    - Device shadow enables offline sync but adds complexity.
