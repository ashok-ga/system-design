# Welcome to System Design Hub

## 🚀 What is This?

System Design Hub is a collaborative, open-source resource for learning, teaching, and documenting **High-Level Design (HLD)** and **Low-Level Design (LLD)** of software and hardware systems.

Whether you are preparing for interviews, architecting a real-world solution, or seeking reference designs, you’ll find clear explanations, diagrams, and design patterns here.

## 📖 What You'll Find Here

- **HLD Docs**: Architectural overviews, technology choices, design decisions, major flows, and system context diagrams.
- **LLD Docs**: Detailed module specs, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, interface contracts, and logic flows.
- **Diagrams & Visuals**: All key concepts are illustrated wherever possible.
- **References**: Further reading, links, standards, and best-practice guides.
- **Contribution Guide**: Friendly guidance for adding your own designs or improvements.
